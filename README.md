# Federated Learning for Secure and Privacy-Preserving IoMT

## Overview
This repository presents a Federated Learning–based framework for securing Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) environments. The proposed approach enables multiple medical devices and healthcare institutions to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing raw patient data, ensuring privacy, security, and regulatory compliance.

## Motivation
Centralized machine learning approaches expose sensitive medical data to privacy breaches and cyberattacks. Federated Learning addresses these challenges by keeping data local while enabling collaborative intelligence across distributed IoMT systems.

## Key Contributions
- Privacy-preserving federated model training
- Secure aggregation of model updates
- Distributed anomaly and intrusion detection
- Improved resilience against IoMT cyberattacks
- Compliance with GDPR and HIPAA principles
